# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
#
# This problem was recently asked by Google.
#
# Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
#
# For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
#
# Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?


a = eval(input('enter the list of numbers '))
k = eval(input('enter the number '))

flag = False
for i in range(len(a)):
    for p in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] + a[p] == k and i != p:
            flag = True
            break
    if flag:
        break

print(flag)
